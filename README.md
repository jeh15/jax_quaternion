# Jaxified version of rowan
Implementing the quaternion library [rowan](https://github.com/glotzerlab/rowan) with a JAX backend.

This repo is a work in progress and will be updated when I need more features of rowan jaxified.

## How to install:
To pip install use the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/jeh15/jax_quaternion.git
```

If you want to run the tests that requires some extra dependencies which can be installed via:
```
pip install "jax_quaternion[testing] @ git+https://github.com/jeh15/jax_quaternion.git"
```
